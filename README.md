# Images-anomaly-detection-on-visual-similarity
Our department is needed to search out a procedure for picture anomaly detection on visual similarity in order to produce one label suggestion tool for users.

The basic idea comes from https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-cluster-images-based-on-visual-similarity-cd6e7209fe34.
It reminds us of many processes, such as dimension reduction, feature extraction and so on.

The process chart for techniques is shown below.
